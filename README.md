# Bootstrapping for Suave.io locally and on Azure.

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

This site is based on [suave-xplat-gettingstarted](https://github.com/hussam/suave-xplat-gettingstarted) by 
[@tpetricek](http://github.com/tpetricek). It is a minimalistic sample that shows how to
create a Suave repository that can be hosted locally and deployed to Azure.

When deployed locally, FAKE will monitor app.fsx for any changes, and reload the server if the code changes.
